# Statistical-Analysis-of-Gene-Expression-Data-of-Lungs

This is a project I did during the course of my Probability and Statistics paper under Prof. Shobha Bagai.
Gene expression analysis is a fundamental tool in bioinformatics, with the aim
of understanding the genetic mechanisms that regulate the behavior of cells and
organisms. GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) GEO is a public functional genomics data repository which is used to access datasets of gene expression which
were analysed using GEOquery library of R and GEO2R tool. One of the key
approaches used in gene expression analysis is hypothesis testing, which allows
researchers to compare different samples and determine if there are significant
differences in gene expression levels between them. A statistical hypothesis is
a statement of the parameters of a population or populations. The hypothesis
testing process involves formulating a null hypothesis, which assumes that there
is no difference between the samples, and an alternative hypothesis, which states
that there is a significant difference between the samples. Several factors need to
be considered when performing hypothesis testing for gene expression analysis,
including the type of experiment, the sample size, the choice of statistical test,
and significance level.In this paper, the dataset obtained is of lung tumor and
normal lung cells which has been analysed on basis of criteria like, tissue type,
gender and smoking history. In conclusion, hypothesis testing is a powerful tool
for gene expression analysis that allows researchers to identify genes that are
deferentially expressed between different samples. However, some changes have
to be made to ensure reliable results.
